## Important

This portfolio project uses **synthetic (fake) data** for demonstration purposes.

## What's Real vs. Simulated

### ✅ Real:
- The business problem (daily manual inventory work)
- The solution approach (Python/SQL automation)
- The time savings (130-260 hours/year)
- The technical skills demonstrated

### 🔄 Simulated:
- All product names and SKUs
- All stock quantities
- All warehouse names
- All financial figures
- All specific numbers

## Why Synthetic Data?

1. **Legal Protection** - Protects former employer's confidential info
2. **Privacy Compliance** - No real business data exposed
3. **Professional Ethics** - Respects NDAs and trade secrets

## For Recruiters

- ✅ The code is my original work
